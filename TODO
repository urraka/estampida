Tasks:
 ☐ Remove Math.floor from everywhere used for pixel adjusting.
 ☐ Investigate weird hull line on top of map 3.
 ☐ Change Animation so it doesn't use Resources. Use whatever resources contain instead.
 ☐ Refactor Physics.LineHull to have an array instead of line, line1, line2.
 ☐ Remove normal from Line object and refactor as necessary.
 ☐ Refactor Physics.WorldLine. Override assign functions, constructor, etc.
