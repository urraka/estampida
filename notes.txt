- Repeat move logic on player when necessary (collided with something, changed to next floor).
- Rename Estampida.js to something more generic (nameless).
- Add main.js instead of embedding code in html.
x Fix bug: force object added to QuadTree to have a method "intersectsRect" instead of passing a bounds object.
