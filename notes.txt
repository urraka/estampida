- Change Animation so it doesn't use Resources. Use whatever resources contain instead.
- Refactor Physics.LineHull to have an array instead of line, line1, line2.
- Remove normal from Line object and refactor as necessary.
/ Refactor Physics.WorldLine. Override assign functions, constructor, etc.
x Fix speeding up on some wall collisions (velocity.x effect).
x Check if it's necessary to return percent from Player2.move().
x Finish jump checking.
x Fix detection of animation.
x Fix collision hull on intersection between wall and floor line.
  x Test polygons with axis aligned edges. Try different cases of triangles.
x Physics.World.moveObject: avoid pulling back kEpsilon if kEpsilon is larger than actual movement.
x Player.move: call createLineHull when necessary.
x Physics.World.createLineHull: recalculate isFloor for line1/line2.
x Repeat move logic on player when necessary (collided with something, changed to next floor).
x Rename Estampida.js to something more generic (nameless).
x Add main.js instead of embedding code in html.
x Fix bug: force object added to QuadTree to have a method "intersectsRect" instead of passing a bounds object.
